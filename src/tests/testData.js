        summary:
          "<p><b>GO</b> is created by Bob Stewart, and is a spin off of his Chain Reaction game show. In Chain Reaction, the two teams (including panellists) had to complete the words that have things in common with each other. The bonus round is timed, with people taking turns one word at a time, finishing the sentence, ringing the bell, until the other team member got all the questions answered correctly. This bonus round is Go's regular rounds. Go created a new bonus round where one team member is surrounded by all of them. After each correct answer, one team member sits out until there is one other team member left (and can ask the question without interruption). If there is time left, the other team members slowly return. Johnny Gilbert returned to announce GO. However, it was hosted by Kevin O'Connell. You ought to be able to remember this game show. The title is short, and all over the stage, at least 27 times. The textured patterns you see on the letters are chains, to celebrate its Chain Reaction heritage.</p>",

          '<p>Yamase Kazuko is a 23-year-old part-time worker who recently got cheated and dumped by her boyfriend and also just lost her job - basically she feels she has reached the rock bottom in life. One day, she walks by a store and finds a teddy bear she fell in love with at first sight. She immediately buys and happily returns home with the teddy bear. The next morning, as she wakes up, what she saw in the mirror was a reflection of herself cuddling with … an tough-looking, middle-aged man! However apparently, no one can see him but Kazuko. He is actually the spirit of a man named Amano Yasuo, a detective who lost his life in the line of duty, hosted within the body of a teddy bear. With exchange conditions, the appealingly odd pair a job-less young female and middle-aged detective decide to work together to uncover the truth behind that criminal case that Amano pursued while he was alive.</p><p>(This show is based on an original work by Miaki Kato\'s novel entitled "Are You Teddy?".)</p>',

Alice seems ready to put it all behind her, especially the painful memory of the genie she fell in love with and lost forever -- the handsome and mysterious Cyrus . But deep down Alice knows this world is real, and just in the nick of time the sardonic Knave of Hearts and the irrepressible White Rabbit arrive to save her from a doomed fate. Together the trio will take a tumble down the rabbit hole to this Wonderland where nothing is impossible.</p>",

Joining McGarrett is Detective Danny \"Danno\" Williams, a relocated ex-New Jersey cop - a working man in paradise who prefers skyscrapers to the coastline - but who's committed to keeping the Islands safe for his young daughter; Chin Ho Kelly, an ex-Honolulu police detective and former protégé of McGarrett's father who was wrongly accused of corruption; Dr. Max Bergman, the quirky coroner; Chin's cousin, Kono Kalakaua, a beautiful and fearless native; and Captain Lou Grover, who formerly headed Hawaii's SWAT unit. Joining them is Jerry Ortega, a former classmate of Chin's and the Island's local conspiracy theorist. The state's brash FIVE-0 unit, who may spar and jest among themselves, remain determined to eliminate the seedy elements from the 50th state.</p>",
